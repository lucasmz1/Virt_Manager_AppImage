# Virt_Manager_AppImage

<br>I've made a few changes now I am using bwrap and it will connect automatically to the qemu:///session; it was clashing xorg on slackware current then I removed the bind to /tmp/.x11-unix, which was the problem that made xorg clash<br/>
all thanks to https://github.com/xplshn, who created this packing management system called AppBundle.
