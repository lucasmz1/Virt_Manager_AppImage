# Virt_Manager_AppImage

<br>The app just works now, download the 0.3 AppBundle, make it executable with chmod +x, or in properties.
the first time the app spawn you may see an error due to libvirt conection, delete it and make an new one, then everything will work fine, it's just a bug due to pack an app that wasn't desinged to be bundled that way. enjoy!<br/>
